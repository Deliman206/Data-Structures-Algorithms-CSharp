# Calculate Height of Binary Tree

Implement a method with the following signature int CalculateBinaryTreeHeight(Node root) that calculates the height of a binary tree.

Hint: The height of a binary tree is the height of its root

### Efficiency

#### Time O(n)
Where n is the number of nodes in the tree, all paths to leaves will be taken into account

#### Space O(h)
Where h is the height of the call stack.
